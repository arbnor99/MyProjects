# MyProjects
Here are some projects that I made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, jQuery, PHP and Laravel.
Inside each projects folder there is a file SQL.sql that contains the database of that project, which you can import.
You can login in all of them using this e-mail: arbnor.gashi99@gmail.com, and one of these
passwords: 12345 or 12345678.
